# Question
How do modules improve our code? Could you give an example of a `default export`?

# Answer

Modules improve our code by keeping it organized and allowing us to reuse functions or code that we have exported.

Example of a `default export`:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

export default add;
```
In this example, add is the `default export` from the module.
