# Question
What is a pure function? Is this function pure?

```js
const rollDice = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
```

# Answer
A pure function is a function that has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input.

The function rollDice is not a pure function because it uses Math.random(), which makes it return a different output each time it is called.
