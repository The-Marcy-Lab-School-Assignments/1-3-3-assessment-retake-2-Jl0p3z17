# Question
Please explain what "scope" is. Write and explain a little code snippet that demonstrates scope in some way.

# Answer
Scope is the area in a function, if statement, or for loop where variables can be used. The code inside the {} defines the scope.

Variables declared with `let` and `const` can only be used inside the block where they are declared. Variables declared with `var` can be used anywhere in the function where they are declared.

For example:

```js
const myFunc = () => {
    if (true) {
        let x = 5;
        const y = 10;
        var z = 20;
    }
    console.log(z); 
}
myFunc();
```
