# Question
You are tasked with writing a program for organizing a grocery list. 

What data type would you use to represent the grocery list? Explain why and provide an example to receive full points.

# Answer
The data type I will use to represent the grocery list is an Array.
I will use an array because it maintains the order of elements, allowing easy access, modification, and iteration over the list.

For example:
```js
const groceryList = ["tomatoes", "lettuce", "carrots", "broccoli"];
```
